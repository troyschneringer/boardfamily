summary: |
  *Mag Blast* is a take-that stick-it-to-your-neighbor game set in space.  As commander of a fleet of space ships, you are tasked with protecting yourself while also inflicting as damage as possible on opponent fleets.  Ready your cannons and fire your Blasts, but don't forget to make a blast sound as you fire or you miss!

  Reinforce your fleet, make tactical moves, launch squadrons and board your opponent's ship to become the most powerful force in the galaxy!
  It's noisy, crazy, a bit cutthroat and a lot of fun for the family that enjoys going at it with each other.

review: |
  What 10 year old doesn't want to blow up their Dad's spaceship out from under him?  And what 10 year old doesn't want to make awesome noises
  while doing said blowing up?  Well, this 37 year loves it!

  Easily the most laugh inducing part of the game, the requirement to make blaster noises while obliterating your opponents is bound to bring
  a fun and noisy dynamic to game night.  It's a simple twist that really makes this game sparkle while you stick to your neighbors.

  On a parental note, this game has really helped us work on having thick skin and losing well.  The whole point of the game is to destroy 
  everyone else and that means exploiting weaknesses and having no mercy.  We've shed tears over some abrupt loses, and it has presented
  many an opportunity to learn to both win and lose with a good attitude.

teachability: |
  If your group is already familiar with multi-phased turns, then *Mag Blast* will be comfortable territory for everyone.
  The phases are straightforward and quick to pick up.
  
  The game is relatively simple and we've have good success playing with 8+.
  However, teaching it all in a single setting to the younger players was a bit much and I have found good success teaching the 
  littles using the recommended mods.

modifications:
  summary: |
    *Mag Blast* lends itself well toward adding in more actions as players get comfortable with the rules.
  mods: 
    - "Blasts only: take out everything except the blasts and practice blowing each other up"
    - "Indirection: Remove the Direct Hits and Direct Hit Effects as these can be complicated for younger (or newer) gamers to understand"
