summary: |
  *Camel Up Cards* is the card based variant of the Camel Up board game.
  Instead of relying on the roll of the dice, each player chooses cards to build a single racing deck that will determine how the camels run each leg of the race.
  Each player also retains a single secret card to play on any turn in hopes of influencing the race in their favor.
  Then the betting begins as the camels race toward the finish line (literally) on top of one another.

  Watch out for the Palm Tree and Fennec as they help and hinder the camels along the way.
  Hold steady if your camel falls behind as the occasional sandstorm has been known to even the racing field quickly.

  This game of unpredictable jockeying for position is bound to leave you laughing and provide a good family game night.

review: |
  I stumbled across *Camel Up Cards* a while back when, on a whim, I chose it as the "Official Game of Staycation 2017."
  It turned out to be a hit as the entire family (kids age 5-9 at the time) was able to participate on their own and have fun doing so.
  There is enough luck in the game that the younger kids who bet randomly did well enough to keep them engaged.
  And the older ones who bet with a more thoughtful approach learned that sometimes well laid plans don't go...well, as planned. 
  *This proved to be a great teachable moment :)*

  The wacky unpredictability makes for good laughs and lots of collective "Arrrrrg"s.
  I love to teach this game to new people and have often found the family coming back to it as well.

teachability: |
  While the recommended age is 8+ we have been playing with kids aged 5+ with no issues.

  The game is very easy to teach gamers of all ages as you have two basic actions on your turn:

  - Take a Racing action
  - Take a Betting action

  The building of the racing deck changes based on the number of players, but there are great visual helper cards so you don't have to remember all the details.

  Teaching the rules takes about 5-10 minutes.

  summary:
    I have found Camel Up Cards to be accessible to gamers of pretty much all ages.
    But if you do have little ones that want to play here's a few *simplifications* that work well without losing the heart of the gameplay.
  mods:
    - Remove the Fennec and the Palm Tree to simplify racing actions
    - Remove race Overall Winner/Loser cards to simplify betting actions
